		<h3>(#section1) Section 1</h3>
		<p>	3. For the students of the 2019 entry of EE department, since one additional DC of 3 credits has already been offered in the current autumn 		semester, they will not be able to take one DC course from the approved list in the next semester.  Moreover they will not be able to take any extra course of any type in the available slot.

 		In summary, for the autumn semester 2020-21, EE students of 2019 entry will take one additional DC course, it will be adjusted by dropping a DC course from the spring semester of 2020-21. This will ensure that the EE department will strictly follow the IIT Jammu curriculum from the autumn semester 2021-22 onwards. The slight departure from the approved IIT Jammu curriculum in the EE dept. for the 2019 entry students for the autument semester 2020-21 will be confined only in the academic year 2020-21 and it will not have any effect from the academic year 2021-22 onwards. This is a one-time exception.


		Thus the students will follow the instructions given below: 

		A1. All students of 2019 entry are allowed to take ONLY the IC courses including the CECs and the DC courses as approved in the Senate.
		A2. All students of the 2019 entry of the EE department, as a special case, will take DC3 in the current autumn semester. (It is a one time departure which will be adjusted in the next semester.)
		A3. In case the students of the 2019 entry of any department in the current autumn semester have opted and registered for any additional course/s for the regular or minor degree requirements, they need to drop the additional course/s at the earliest and latest before the deadline of the course-adjustment expires.
		A4. The above decisions are final and no further requests will be entertained. 


		Thanks lot for your kind understanding and cooperation.

		Sincerely yours,
		GD
